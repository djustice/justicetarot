The Chariot (Upright)\n\nOkay so some people actually consider this card to be a wake up call or a pain in the back because it\'s not an easy flowing card. When this card is drawn it means it\'s time to put your nose to the grindstone. When you examine the details in this card you can clearly see an individual in high authority and being pulled by sphinxes or horses which are also powerful creatures. This imagery is showing you where you could end up if you really push yourself to your limits and even to your breaking point. This card is also translated as a \"yes\" card if you are asking a yes or no question, however it\'s going to take a lot of energy from you with this \"yes\" answer. It\'s not a bath thing it just means you got what it takes to sit on the throne.\n\nThe Chariot (Love)\n\nBeing that this card is already an aggressive yet positive one. It\'s showing that you are grounded when it comes to who you want and that there could be some other competitors after the same person. Don\'t let that stop you from showing out because this is giving you the green light to put on a show and win over their love and surely disturb the others attempting to get in your way.\n\nThe Chariot (Reversed)\n\nStop pushing yourself to your breaking point you have proven enough for now. It\'s time to start taking care of yourself and practice some deep breathing exercises. You may feel like you are not at a good stopping point but it\'s time to at least slow down before you end up hurting your physical body. No extra tasks or favors should be done when this card is pulled in reverse. The moon rules this card so you should consider moon bathing and enjoy company in dim lit areas. Keep some secrets and don\'t let anyone in your inner circle until your personal healing is complete.\n\nThe Chariot (Career)\n\nYou don\'t have to be complete because this card is in your spread but you are wanting to climb a ladder with people with the same goal to achieve that position of power are in your way and they could very well know it. Get creative with your tactics and start showing your superiors what you are made of and what you are willing to do. When it comes to the career this card is viewed as a little bit vicious because of how intense it\'s energy and sheer presents is as a tarot card and the art shows the possibility of you calling the shots and being on top but if you are not willing to step over those in your way you very well could be pulling the chariot.
