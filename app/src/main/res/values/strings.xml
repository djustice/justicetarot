    <string name="a_00_fool_p">The Fool is the symbol of true innocence, a perfect state of joy and freedom, the sure feeling to be one with the spirit of life, at any time.\n\nThe Fool has the number 0, for someone ready to go in any direction, open to all possibilities. He belongs nowhere, has no past, but an infinite future. Every moment is a new beginning. In arabic letters the 0 has the shape of an egg, the symbol for the origin of life. The Fool is change, motion and the readiness to jump into life, with no cares ever. The Fool knows no difference between possibility and reality, the zero means a total lack of hope and fear, the Fool suspects and plans nothing. He reacts directly to the current situation, nothing is calculated, nothing is hidden.\n\nIn most decks the Fool is shown with an animal, as a symbol of nature, the animal soul in perfect harmony with the spirit that just follows its instincts. The Fool is courage, optimism and the belief in life and himself. When times are hard, and we suffer the pressure of \'being reasonable\' or denying our instincts, the Fool reminds us that our inner person knows best what to do. \'Always trust your instincts\'…\n\nIn its negative aspect, the card can say that its qualities are blocked or reversed. Irresponsibility, mad projects, recklessness - the careless human who covers himself with some artificial madness, for distrusting his instincts and fearing standstill and silence.</string>
    <string name="a_01_magus_p">The Magician represents consciousness, action and creation. He\'s the symbol for the idea of manifestation - the possibility of making an idea come true. He gives meaning and direction to life, and he reminds us that the emotional and creative powers of our souls must have a physical basis to be of real use. Powers unused are powers non-existent, we have to set them free in order to use them, and to gain and renew. The Magician is related to the Mercurius of alchemy.\n\nThe Magician shows that we\'re aware of the power in life, he can be a symbol for all the creative skills and ideas inside. Most people don\'t really act, they just react, being driven from one situation to the next. The Magician tells that a power is ready to use as soon as it is recognized, to see and go the own way.\n\nThe negative side of the card could mean that the free run of energy is blocked, that we can feel the energy but can\'t use it. This could mean fear and restlessness, even the fear to go insane.\n\nFinally there\'s a negative aspect in the abuse of energy.</string>
    <string name="a_02_priestess_p">The High Priestess represents the deeper, more subtle aspect of the female archetype - the darkness, the mystery, psychic power, the might of the moon to enlighten the subconscious. The High Priestess is silence, passivity, containing a power of her own. Only when retiring from the world, can we allow our subconscious to rise, listen to our inner voice and recognize our spiritual power.\n\nMost people never rest like this, as our society supports the total suppression of the subconscious, but without it we will never understand ourselves. The High Priestess is inner wisdom at its deepest, a wisdom that cannot be expressed in rational terms. Trying so, we would already falsify and restrict it\n\nAs a symbol for deeper knowledge, the card can express a feeling of darkness, which might also be a feeling of fear, but also a feeling of beauty. We know there is more inside than we can see.\n\nIn a negative aspect, the High Priestess could stand for passivity at the wrong time, leading to weakness and a fear of life. It could mean that a person is very sensitive but unable to touch their feelings or just live with their feelings.</string>
    <string name="a_03_empress_p">The Empress (upright)\n\n She is usually associated with material influence but every woman knows that the things in the material are only as valuable as the memory attached to that item. Earth (mother earth) is associated with the empress. Incredibly grounded you could and should dismiss the nonsense in your way. The empress is mostly femanine but can also accompany or ground male energy as well - presenting the natural energy of this card from femanine to masculine depending on what exactly the empress has in mind. At a relaxed pace those associating with the empress card can know they are safe.\n\nThe Empress (love)\n\nThis card is personal in the love life as it is referring solely to you. Developing a relationship with yourself is not what everyone wants to hear but it\'s how you will truly get to know yourself and be able to then show this type of care and emotion to another. When everything that you feel you have done gives you a sense of self growth and profound thinking you will also unlock very sociable and new attention as well. Venus is the ruling planet of this card so desire has the top shelf of emotions with the empress.\n\nThe Empress (Reversed)\n\nThe reverse of the empress is really sad in overall energy. Unlike the upright and energetic empress. The reverse is everything you never wanted and didn\'t ask for. This can come out in the worst forms such as an unwanted pregnancy, relationships running dry and becoming stagnant of any facets. This will include both emotional and physical matters. To make it worse something could very well be draining your finances and energy leaving you with no favorable options.\n\nThe Empress (Career)\n\nYou wont be able to take a logical route in your career choice. The more abnormal your career is the creative you have to become. The energy is fimanine in this card and usually femanine energy has a way about working nature and art into the picture. While staying at least a little realistic at the same time. It\'s really hard to balance those two things out. Even if it isn\'t easy just know this where you can start getting creative with things because that is the only way to take this challenge on.</string>
    <string name="a_04_emperor_p">Trumps III and IV represent Parents in their archetypal way. Just as the Empress stands for Mother Nature, the Emperor is the social word, the structure of civilization, a symbol for its law and order, may they be good or bad, but the power behind them. He is the abstraction of establishment, its stability and security.\n\nIn its negative aspects the card can represent the force of bad law in a society where stability is rated higher than morals or ethic. Once law and order are established as an institution, a bad emperor can turn out to be a disaster. And even at his best the Emperor is limited - he puts restrictions and borders to the spontaneity of spirit and nature.\n\nIn a more personal view the Emperor might stand for a time of stability and structure, linear thinking and discipline. Yet we can\'t live without it, too many of those attributes will only lead to rational despotism and mental poverty.</string>
    <string name="a_05_hierophant_p">The Hierophant is a symbol for a world of belief and confession, may it be a church, a sect or an occult society. He\'s the pope, the druid or the High Priest in a system of creeds and dogmas. He represents the religious and intellectual tradition of a person, and may be the one the person is born to it or possibly the one who has chosen it by himself.\n\nIn the positive aspect, the Hierophant represents the search for knowledge and illumination, the desire to study creed and dogma instead of simply accepting them, to research and achieve further development. It also stands for the deep fulfillment someone can find when really trusting their own beliefs.\n\nIn a negative view, the Hierophant can stand for bigotry, the blind faith in dogma, intolerance towards everything different from the own confession. It can also mean gullibility, running to any kind of new belief just because the traditional one is suddenly considered boring or unsatisfying.</string>
    <string name="a_06_lovers_p">The Lovers (Upright)\n\nThis card comes with a lot of juicy details . Don\'t shy away just yet it\'s time for you to acknowledge that you are deserving of so much in life especially when it comes to emotions and our original clays used to shape our most human of elements. Humans in general are taught that the key components of our foundation such as deep breathing, nutrient intake, creating a home, covering yourself, and deep rest are humanities \"must haves\" before you are able to take it up a notch. The lovers card has two sides to it. Just as every story has more than one part and point of view. Matters of the heart may fancy different wants and \"must haves\". If there is advice flowing in from Somewhere off far or not from a place you expected - mingle it with your own for best results. There is so much to be discovered here. Don\'t lose yourself as you explore these layers regardless of it being official or something that is strictly of the moment.\n\nThe Lovers (Love)\n\nThings can get interesting if you are trying to reference the lovers tarot. Something should come naturally but it seems like they may not be set in stone. Being shy is not going to help you during this spell, note that pisces is associated with this card as well and you would be grateful if you are receiving compassion from this constellation. It\'s association with both male and female energies is positive and actually allows a lot of free play when it comes to this card\'s love life. Tones from the aurora blanket this card teals, silvers, purples and greys are highlighting your potential connections.\n\nThe Lovers (Reversed)\n\nThis is the time to start gathering what you would consider values and presenting them either in your life or with a partner. Imbalance can be a disturbing thing by the time you realize what\'s been causing this imbalance it could already be too late. Listening and processing take time but you can\'t dwell on it either. During this shift through time you are going to be responsible for your actions and hold to the options you select. Maybe rethink a few choices before you make them. Taurus is usually friendly and trustworthy of pisces so don\'t completely dismiss the taurus because of this card\'s reversal but rather just keep an eye on this that could be changing between these two signs.\n\nThe Lovers (Career)\n\nAs far as the lovers being placed into the potential of career possibilities just remember to keep your love life and career life separated. This doesn\'t exactly mean for a single person to immediately discard someone else in the work environment. This card is basically saying for the reader to keep an at work relationship on the more calm side and dont parade around about it or it\'s going to prevent your potential promotions. The signs associated with this card are taurus, virgo, cancer and pisces. Those that fall under these signs are going to have a very attractive draw to them starting soon and even temptation. Don\'t let flirtatious side quests take your full attention away from your original career goals. It could be a long time before you get that drive back to step it up and achieve what you have been building up to.</string>
    <string name="a_07_chariot_p">The Chariot (Upright)\n\nOkay so some people actually consider this card to be a wake up call or a pain in the back because it\'s not an easy flowing card. When this card is drawn it means it\'s time to put your nose to the grindstone. When you examine the details in this card you can clearly see an individual in high authority and being pulled by sphinxes or horses which are also powerful creatures. This imagery is showing you where you could end up if you really push yourself to your limits and even to your breaking point. This card is also translated as a \"yes\" card if you are asking a yes or no question, however it\'s going to take a lot of energy from you with this \"yes\" answer. It\'s not a bath thing it just means you got what it takes to sit on the throne.\n\nThe Chariot (Love)\n\nBeing that this card is already an aggressive yet positive one. It\'s showing that you are grounded when it comes to who you want and that there could be some other competitors after the same person. Don\'t let that stop you from showing out because this is giving you the green light to put on a show and win over their love and surely disturb the others attempting to get in your way.\n\nThe Chariot (Reversed)\n\nStop pushing yourself to your breaking point you have proven enough for now. It\'s time to start taking care of yourself and practice some deep breathing exercises. You may feel like you are not at a good stopping point but it\'s time to at least slow down before you end up hurting your physical body. No extra tasks or favors should be done when this card is pulled in reverse. The moon rules this card so you should consider moon bathing and enjoy company in dim lit areas. Keep some secrets and don\'t let anyone in your inner circle until your personal healing is complete.\n\nThe Chariot (Career)\n\nYou don\'t have to be complete because this card is in your spread but you are wanting to climb a ladder with people with the same goal to achieve that position of power are in your way and they could very well know it. Get creative with your tactics and start showing your superiors what you are made of and what you are willing to do. When it comes to the career this card is viewed as a little bit vicious because of how intense it\'s energy and sheer presents is as a tarot card and the art shows the possibility of you calling the shots and being on top but if you are not willing to step over those in your way you very well could be pulling the chariot.</string>
    <string name="a_08_adjustment_p">The Adjustment is a symbol for the balance of contrasts, complementing one another and also building up room and time. She combines the High Priestess and the Magician. Both are connected - true, conscious action results from realization, wisdom is based on action. The principle of activity completes itself with the passivity of inner reflection, the adjustment being the balance in between.\n\nAnother common name of this trump is \'Justice\' - the card tells one to be righteous in all aspects of our life, to ignore, suppress or prefer none if need be. Only when we have an objective view of all and accept them, can we can find inner balance and silence.\n\nTherefore, the Adjustment stands for uncompromising honesty and objectivity, the realization of cause and effect, background and consequence.</string>
    <string name="a_09_hermit_p">The Hermit represents retirement from the outside world, introversion into the inner self, listening to the inner voice and caring for the inner self. He requires retreat from any \'high life\' and loud company, and stands for a time of self-reflection and self-realization.\n\nFor most people, the silent loneliness of the Hermit appears unattractive, but behind the Hermit is the wisdom of the High Priestess. You cannot listen to your inner voices while having a party..\n\nIn its negative aspect, the Hermit could mean being afraid of others or of life. When the retreat turns out to be a runaway, the loneliness can turn into a jail.</string>
    <string name="a_10_fortune_p">The Wheel of Fortune is a symbol of destiny and destination, of good luck and bad luck, of the ups and downs of life and fate. Everything is in motion, turning and floating, constantly changing, accidental and uncontrollable.\n\nThe trump also represents the need to be careful, to realize and recognize the vagaries of life, to accept the fact that fate is nothing what we could have done, but the result of what we already did. Today is the result of the past, future will be the sum of past and today, and no matter how accurately we plan, the Wheel of Fortune will mix up light and shadow.\n\nWhether the Wheel of Fortune is positive or negative is not a matter of happenstance or events in the first place; but rather of the way we will deal with the results, arrange our lives with the unchangeable and work on what we might be able to change - and of course of our ability to realize facts.</string>
    <string name="a_11_lust_p">The Passion is the step into the second decade of the Major Arcana, the point where the journey into the inner depth begins. In other decks, this trump is called \'The Power\', a symbol for the mastery of our own animal side. Crowley named the card \'Lust\' - and most people don\'t really think of mastering their inner animal, but enjoy it full tilt…\n\nIn a combination of both, the animal side shouldn\'t be \'mastered\' in the meaning of \'suppressed\', nor should it be let out to \'romp around\'. It should not be ignored, but accepted as a natural part of oneself. In that manner, one will not only be able to profit from its instinctive natural power, but also to save the power needed to \'master\' it.\n\nThe Passion implies vitality, energy and power. The card tells us to use these riches. In most aspects of life, an endeavor will have much more success when passion is put into it.</string>
    <string name="a_12_hanged_man_p">The Hanged Man is a symbol for the turning points in life, showing up a need to stop and assess a situation. We\'re hanging in the air until we find a new view of the things around us, a proper way to rearrange or restart.\n\nBut the Hanged Man is a \'silent\' card - there\'s no pressing need for change. No big change is waltzing towards us - we can peacefully keep on hanging and complaining. The Hanged Man just shows that we\'re just \'hanging\', he requires a new viewpoint, and sometimes a lot of patience.\n\nIn its positive aspect, the card shows the need for a time of consideration, the forced relaxation gives the opportunity to relax and reflect, to sort thoughts and ideas and find a new way to cope with a situation.</string>
    <string name="a_13_death_p">There hardly is a card provoking so many \'oops\' in a reading - never forget that the Death is meant as an archetype, a symbol.\n\nThe Death represents the never ending circle of death and rebirth as the precondition for new life and creation, for life is permanently changing, hello and good-bye, leaving and arriving.\n\nThe Death will show that something has ended and something will begin, and doesn\'t care if the end is painful and the new beginning welcomed or vice versa. The card implies the need to let something go, and requires the understanding of the circles of life.\n\nThe negative aspect of the card could plainly mean that we want to keep what we have to give up, that no change is welcomed. In most cases it is just a refusal to understand and accept. It can mean we are scared of loss and also afraid to restart.</string>
    <string name="a_14_art_p">Art (Upright)\n\nCreate a balance in your overall life not just one are and while doing this Try to remain away from any extreme life changes that are within your control. Taking the low or high road at this time is going to cause a major power shift in your most valued environment. Practice emotional restraint and you will gain insight into a lot of past issues. Keeping calm so you can keep moving along for now is going to help you develop some new coping skills. The ruling planet for this card is Jupiter and the element associated with this card is Fire!\n\nArt (Love)\n\nBe cautious and thoughtful in your actions because harmony is trying to align itself with you and possibly even with something new in the very close future. Art is one of the better cards you can recieve in while actually in a relationship because if everything is going smoothly and you feel like you and your partner are in sync and harmony with your goals - they are going to be achieved. This is a dynamic duo card for lovers which means heavy with passion and drizzled with experimentation for the both of you! If you are seeking a partner and have this card show up during your reading. Meeting someone soon is a high probability. Just remember to keep your cool and don\'t get too nervous; it can actually scare your future lover off.\n\nArt (Reversed)\n\nArt in reverse is going to be the exact opposite of upright and in this meaning it stands for the imbalances in your life that you have neglected to fix. Leaving something and trying to ignore it is dangerous and can lead to extremes in anxiety and depression. Just as this card means balance and harmony upright when reversed it\'s screaming at you to master your emotions, increase your bravery and use the other cards in this spread to possibly identify where you need to start to fix this and yourself.\n\nArt (Career)\n\nThis is going to be a great time for you to START setting your goals. Don\'t rush yourself and plan accordingly because you are going to have to be patient when it comes to reaching some of these goals. But if you can keep yourself on a respectable schedule and provide focus and cut out those who are disturbing your peace you are sure to reach them and if you are slow to anger while setting these goals and taking the first two steps to reaching this goal then quickly you shall achieve.</string>
    <string name="a_15_devil_p">Reducing the long story of the Devil to its roots, there was an archangel called Lucifer (light bringer) who said \'I\'m born to be free - I don\'t serve!\'\n\nLater on there was a despotic religion that annihilated everything else, destroyed age old cultures and beliefs, and suppressed natural wisdom and science. Then, the world was provided with perverted rags like Dante\'s \'Divine Comedy\', while everything scientific landed in the fire. But for all the \'evil\' there was a perfect scapegoat - the devil..\n\nIn the Tree of Life the Devil goes from consciousness and harmony to intellect and logic - against all dogma, never caring for rules, freely uncompromising and independent. There are no restrictions, no limitations, nothing is forbidden. The Devil is aware of the darkness, he knows all the shadows and will go on researching even at a high price.\n\nIn a positive aspect, the Devil tells us to go ahead with whatever we want, even when the results won\'t be comfortable. Never forget that half of the great scientists in history ended up on a scaffold or were accused of \'heresy\'.\n\nTherefore, the negative aspect of the card can mean loneliness, misunderstanding, or that someone is outcast and damned.\n\nOn the other hand of course, it could mean that applying a little restriction here and there wouldn\'t have been the worst solution.\n\nBy the way, I don\'t mean that you should see the Devil as a person, or take the plain image of someone with horns and hoof seriously. The little paragraph above is just to help you to see and use the powerful potential of trump XV in its intended manner.\n\nBaudelaire once wrote that: "the devil\'s best trick was to convince us he doesn\'t exist". It could certainly be said that the devil has done a good job when we recognize that there actually isn\'t one…</string>
    <string name="a_16_tower_p">The Tower (Upright)\n\nWhenever the tower appears in a spread it\'s almost always seen as a dangerous card to have around. It suggests sudden changes in your life that there were no ways of knowing what would have happened to even try and prevent it. Destruction is the energy that this card carries. But considering that this card is in the upright position, maybe it\'s others that should be taking a moment to back up from you and show a little respect.\n\nThe Tower (Love)\n\nLove can be a hard thing to pin down. But as this Tower card is know for the destructive reputation that is even included in matters of the heart. If you are strong in your foundation this card is a sign to push on even when the emotional rollercoaster is hard to fight off. A foundation that has large cracks in it that are obvious and is clearly weakening are not going to last much longer. At all. What can be said in positive light of this card is that when you have to break off that relationship with such a toxic other half you are now making the way for enlightenment and new experiences.\n\nThe Tower (Reversed)\n\nWhen the tower is reversed you can take a lot of the gloom and doom out of the picture. It still means you\'re going to have to put forth your best effort but you\'ll be able to disperse chaos quickly and have hindesight on your side as well. The element of this card is Fire. But instead of leaving fire and destruction wherever you or your opponent goes you are lighting lanterns and candles for those on your path or those trying to find new views and purposes in life.\n\nThe Tower (Career)\n\nIt\'s going to be an uphill battle and as long as you keep your footing you will be sure to make it to where you want to be in your field. Although this may not happen during your first attempt as you need backup and things to support your words. Actions to prove you can keep up and keep going. If your tower isn\'t completed the first time around, give it another shot. You built your tower once already and now you need to reinforce it.</string>
    <string name="a_17_star_p">The Star (Upright)\n\nA card that brings the word trustworthy to mind. With this card there is a lot being said but only to you. This card Is speaking directly, no extra baggage to one individual and no other, no dead-ends, no baggage, family member or partner - just you. Stop pushing to make things happen. This time you shouldn\'t have to try very hard to make your point or hold off on that debut you\'ve been putting off. It is a time to feel like you belong and are exactly where you should be. Don\'t let anyone cause you to loose your temper now. Doing so will damage your current standing and there is no time for a falling star. Hope will be your weapon to weild and renewal is going to be your sheild. Getting to be that open and expressive can make you withhold some of your talents and knowledge but it\'s a good thing. As you begin to explore this type of popularity there are going to be some frowns in the crowd. Don\'t stress about what you have to do be sure to allow the feeling of guilt blend away slowly but this card is giving you the green light to thin out your fan base because this action is going to be the lessons that teaches you how to identify the real qualities of true friendship and the long term potential. Stars leave dust in their tails. Everything you had to go through to get to this point will and is going to be worth it. Lessons learned and bad vibes cut off from here on out.\n\nThe star (Love)\n\nNothing is ending at this time, in fact it\'s only the beginning so stay sane and really let your playful ways and energy press on because it\'s uphill from here. If you are single you are probably shaking your head no - even if you just came from the ending of a relationship think about it stars love to play and they enjoy the company of someone who can bring on new ideas that can also be an invitation to try things with someone that is in a different social class as you. Different degrees and ranges of energy levels as well. Currently in a relationship? Good you are already halfway there! Lock the door! OR if privacy is the is the issue this is the time to get your own Foundation started or even test the waters with something like an apartment. Either way you look at it, it\'s clear to see things are heating up and this is going to be an ongoing exchange of many expressions. Let\'s also take a moment to admire those natural born loners who actually value all of their free time to themselves. The loner Stars have a thing for creating master works of art and wordy expressions of the reality they witness from their close circle of socialites. Being asked to take part in one of their creations should be taken as a high honor - feel honored during this transaction and both sides will display and offer their best parts and most high of energies.\n\nThe Star (Reversed)\n\nSimilar in some ways to the cards upright position. This is all about you and it\'s time for you to start to somewhat be the bad guy In the next few turns in this chapter of your life. Have a very selfish moment this year because as you have suffered and been made to grin and bare call that has entailed your responsibilities and detailed requests that never seem to have an end just know ... that now there is an end. when you look out as part and it\'s clearly upside down bot notice as stars in the sky are upright but in the reversed stance his would appear to the viewer thant the stars are leaving - things are changing and you are experiencing confusion not only in delicate, sorrowful ways but in fear of what this is going to cause as the ripple effect has now at this very moment been activated. Trying to put a band aid over a deep wound does nothing. Take a deep breath, it\'s time to use what you know to make it out with your sanity still intact. Now that you know you are going to be part of a major life pivoting event make the required arrangments so that when you are called upon to travel you actually can. The fact that you have been forced into confinement is actually what is playing a big part of this need to travel. It\'s time to stand up and fix a few things. Embrace these very rare opportunities. They will not be offered In the future. \n\nThe Star (Career)\n\nExplore some sub categories that are popular in your field. These lush opportunities have a respectable 75% chance of taking you to new heights and discovering new limitations. Improve quickly and with honesty these new found limitations will be what also secures you for task in the far future. The energy of the stars will never stop amazing those that run the show. They are also always looking for something now. Shiney and easy to spot and easy on the eyes. Don\'t take being eye candy as an insult. Those eyes of yours were made not only for gazing at your fellow stars but also being part of the top shelf means you get to assist another smaller star in their career growth. It\'s going to look great on both of you and feel like a whole new world. A meteor shower is the first sign to push your self and underlings.</string>
    <string name="a_18_moon_p">The Moon will lead us into the blackest depths of our soul, into the world of the subconscious, where there are no more words, just images and notions. It represents a journey into the darkest night, a look behind our own face.\n\nThe Moon isn\'t the most comfortable trump - though everybody likes to equate it with the mysteries, rarely someone really enjoys the look into their own abyss, where sometimes the unvarnished truth is not too pleasant. Embarrassingly enough, the Moon tends to show up what we generally ignore, refuse to see, or even deny all the time. But the step has to be taken, for without facing up to darkness, we will never see the light.\n\nUnlike most trumps, the Moon has no real negative aspect, but it implies a serious danger. The journey into night could be too much when we\'re not prepared and we might get lost in our own shadow.</string>
    <string name="a_19_sun_p">The Sun (Upright)\n\nThis card can easily be recognized as one of the most optimistic and geared towards better outcomes. The Sun is the highest point on this card meaning to keep your head up even if things are not going as you planned because it is going to change into a full fledged higher toned destination. The rays of the Sun are absolutely splaying outward in every direction which should give you a sense of calm and the need to be curious at this section of your life, especially since things are picking up from here with a clear Shot to be on the better side of things. The only thing that can even attempt to bring you down is your own fears. Embody the yin energy and grow with it.\n\n\nThe Sun (Love)\n\nLove and earned romance are just a small fraction of your reward. In just a small amount of time you have created a new found joy in someone\'s heart. A horse in this card is clearly visible and part of the balance in this front of the card\'s artwork. Horses are part of the Chinese Zodiac and have always been seen as a passionate, energetic, selective and free spirited animal so with the right one both of you can experience each. Other not only physically but on a much deeper and personal level. A yin-yang, fire and ice type of connection that soul mates and twin flames discover during their more early life time.\n\nThe Sun (Reversed)\n\nIn a way it\'s like staring into a black hole Sun. As the reversed Sun is part of an ever evolving plan to illuminate what is hidden in the dark. This card reversed strongly embodies the saying \"What is done in the dark will come to the light.\" This card is telling it\'s holder to get ready to hear some things that might not be easy to comprehend. If this is the case then you should prepare yourself mentally. If you are the giver of this form of information, tread lightly because there is some form of brain fog or negative influence providing false clarity. Be wise on what you witness and take from it. The ruling planet of this card is still the Sun. Silver linings are still a possibility.\n\n\nThe Sun (Career)\n\nCareers that have the Sun card in them are really on the up and up when it comes to personal influence that you bring to the table. If you are at work and you are noticing that where you go and whoever you run into are left with a breath of fresh air and positive feelings - this is going to be a sign that you are headed in the right direction. Material happiness plays a role in this card referring to careers. So if you are after a material life and this career can provide that stepping stone, continue with these actions and you\'ll achieve great things and attract the right crowd.</string>
    <string name="a_20_aeon_p">The Aeon is the trump of time and the changes dictated by the times, it addresses finality and destruction as well as liberation, hope and redemption.\n\nThe Aeon is the symbol for the Rise of Phoenix, it stands for a time of insight, the true understanding of the circle of life, of growing and fading. The card tells us that we should leave our \'frog perspective\' and watch the things from a higher level, that the time has come to face the new, that we need a good overview to build our \'Utopia\'.\n\nIn older decks the Aeon is called \'Judgment\', dealing with resurrection and redemption. The limitation of this view is the involuntary association to a \'court of law\', to the Christian concept of a \'Resurrection\' where the pious may rise and the rest must burn.\n\nAlthough trump XX indeed does imply a judgement, it wouldn\'t be appropriate to restrict this meaning with such a superstitious simplification.</string>
    <string name="a_21_universe_p">The Universe as the end and completion of the Major Arcana is the symbol for the zenith of development - the achieved goal. The work is done or will soon be and we have found our place in life or will soon do so.\n\nSeeing the second decade of the Major Arcana as a way of self-realization, the Universe becomes the crown and the end. The Death was the rebirth, the Art the beginning of the alchemical work, the Devil the overcoming of restrictions, the Tower the breakdown of the jail. We followed the Star, explored the Moon, found the Sun and watched the Phoenix rise from the ashes. Finally, we touched the Universe.\n\nOn a more practical level the Universe implies the good news that a goal has been achieved, or a success sure to come, and that a venture will flourish.\n\nIn its negative aspect the trump can tell us that we are running after false ideas, that our way leads nowhere, that it is far too early to reach out for the Universe for there\'s substantial work that has yet to be done.</string>
    <string name="cups_01_p">The Ace of Cups shows the way deep into our soul, to detect beauty and trust. It stands for the sources of love, for growing feelings, the desire for a relationship or the readiness to have a friend.\n\nReferring to the Kaballah, the Ace of Cups is attached to Briah - the world of pure feeling and sensitive intention. It is the female counterpart of the Ace of Wands, representing the female element water as a sign for devotion and care.\n\nThe card also tells that the beauty and the ugly are two poles belonging together. Without shadow, there\'s no light - and mud is needed to make lilies blossom.</string>
    <string name="cups_02_p">The Two of Cups is the polarisation of the freely floating streams of the Ace of Cups. Where the Ace was all-embracing in its feelings, the Two of Cups has a particular focus. The Ace was unity, the Two of Cups is differentiation, feelings are focussed on a specific object.\n\nRemembering that 2 as a number is the symbol of duality, it implies the Two of Cups needs a counterpart, a source or a goal outside itself.</string>
    <string name="cups_03_p">The Three of Cups will combine the qualities of both the Ace and the Two of Cups. The undirected love has found its goal, it will grow and blossom. The 3 (triad) as the number of synthesis and harmony will pour its riches into the seas of Binah, the understanding and realization.\n\nTherefore, the Three of Cups shows that we have found joy and fulfillment in love and devotion, we are aware of the worth and understand its meaning.</string>
    <string name="cups_04_p">In the Four of Cups the emotions are stabilized. A relationship might be comfortable, but it is fixed, the zenith is already crossed and the worth is taken as granted. When there is no more risk, freedom and excitement are lost.\n\nThe 4 as the number of structure and reality implies a certain authority, it provides security and order. This might be useful when it comes to Disks, but emotions can\'t breathe with too much control, waters will foul when kept from floating.\n\nTherefore, the Four of Cups is not quite the best choice ever, and it shows. Behind the bright glamour of the four golden cups the grey sadness of emptiness is already lurking.</string>
    <string name="cups_05_p">The Five of Cups stands for an emotional crisis. It might be that unconscious fears come true, it could tell that feelings are disrupted or wasting away, the soul is empty and unfulfilled.\n\nIn the sequence of the cups, the Five is the logical consequence of the Four. The grey sadness that was lurking behind the luxury\'s glamour is now exposed, the \'truth is out\'.\n\nThe Five of Cups implies the loss of illusion, the realization of a deception. It hurts, but is necessary when we don\'t want to spend the rest of our lives with our heads in the sand. The 5 is the quintessence, the power that exceeds the 4 - Geburah is motion and changing, the power of destruction. To put it plain: we have to learn how to crawl before we can learn to walk.</string>
    <string name="cups_06_p">The Six of Cups has overcome the crisis of the Five, it has learned and accepted its lesson.\n\nTiphareth is the center, standing for beauty and harmony, the realization of consciousness. The 6 as the number of completion solves the imbalance of the 5, it combines the contrasts and reconciles the opposites. The 6 is open to all directions.\n\nSo the Six of Cups will tell of deep emotions, that have passed the depths of pain and fear and therefore will enjoy the pleasures of harmony and devotion more than ever before.</string>
    <string name="cups_07_p">The Seven of Cups are standing for the waters of delusion, the clouds of intoxication, the emotional waters are rotting in the depths of destiny, they have fallen from the grace of Tiphareth.\n\nThe Seven of Cups also talks of the human desire to experience the unknown, the subconscious, the wish to escape the plain old reality and find a better world somewhere in fantasy. But it shows clearly the dangers of such mind games, when the dreaming turns into a hapless runaway from life. The success is illusionary, just a deception or wishful thinking\n\nIn its best aspects, the Seven of cups is a warning to recognize the delusion, the disguises, to get rid of the intoxicating feelings and face up the facts. Netzach is not only anarchy, but creativity - so the realization of the bad can lead to something good when used with care.</string>
    <string name="cups_08_p">The Eight of Cups has driven the debauch of the Seven to absolute excess, the delusions have lost all attraction and all that\'s left is frustration. The sequence of the numbers has reached Hod, calling for structure and logic, but the emotional waters of Briah cannot be happy with this call and remain in dumb resignation.\n\nNevertheless, happy or not, the call must be heard to leave the bogs of numbness, and the Eight of Cups tells us to abandon the past, leave the current situation, make up our minds most honestly and open our eyes to upcoming changes.</string>
    <string name="cups_09_p">With Yesod - reflection and imagination - inside of the perfect harmony of the Nine, the Nine of Cups has returned to the middle column of the Tree of Life, enlightened by the beauty of Tiphareth that resides above and just one step from Malkuth as its root and origin, the completion of the journey.\n\nNothing serves the waters of Briah better than the seas of Yesod, so the card shows perfect harmony and fulfilment in any emotional matter.\n\nOn its shadow site, the card shows the risk of self-indulgence and complaisance, the temptation to just enjoy the happiness but forget the reflection that keeps the light upon the waters alive.</string>
    <string name="cups_10_p">With the Ten of Cups, the suit has completed the journey from the seeds of the Ace to the final goal of Malkuth, root and origin of the element. All energies are ending, the have found their fixed forms. The waters are resting now in their final grounds.\n\nYet the Ten is not the end of a line, but the end of a circle - the cross sum of 10 is 1 and there we are at the Ace again. After all the ups and downs of the journey, we find ourself at its beginning, and it is up to us whether we use our experiences or not.</string>
    <string name="cups_princess_p">The Princess of Cups represents the earth in the waters of Briah, an island floating in the groundless seas. She is far from her father\'s flames and her mother\'s depth, and she lacks the researching spirit of her brother. She is of endless tenderness, kindness and loving, living on her isle of romance and joy.\n\nTherefore, an unaffected spectator might take her as childish or selfish, but the island of the princess can be so fertile and rich. Artistically inclined talents can be detected and supported, medial abilities can rise and deeper insights can be gained.\n\nOn the dark side, the island can turn out to be a castle made of sand, sinking in the seas of irrationality and daydreaming. The Princess of Cups, unwilling to leave her realm outside the \'common\' world, may sink with it and at its worst might seduce others to follow her.</string>
    <string name="cups_prince_p">The Prince of Cups represents the Air above the waters, as the son of the Knight and the Queen - Fire and Water - he combines both the fiery flames and the watery depths of his parents, bringing them up in the heights of the Air, storming towards Yetzirah.\n\nSo the Prince of Cups has all the emotional depths of the water, but also the intellectual values of the Air. He is clever and open minded, and his emotional soul can make him a sensitive artist or philosophy. Due to the heritage of Briah, he appears introverted and reversed, and indeed he tends to keep his secrets to himself. Like both his parents, he seems to be easy susceptible, but the sharp minded air makes him choose fairly what to accept in the end.\n\nOn the shadowy side, the Prince of Cups can be reckless and selfish, always striving to improve his own goals and studies, carelessly sacrificing relations in order to perfect his art or passion, and he can be quite shifty in dealings.</string>
    <string name="cups_queen_p">The Queen of Cups represents water in water, she is the purest manifestation of the soul of the waters. Thus she represents pure emotion, passion, feeling, never influenced by judgement or purpose. She is loving and affectionate, a warm-hearted mother and a tender friend, looking into the depths of the heart.\n\nOn the darker side, the Queen of Cups lacks the stability of the Earth, the will of Air and Fire. Water in water is all passivity and has no powers of its own, but makes a perfect transformer of any other power coming along. So she is susceptible to all kinds of influences, her instability might let her appear unreliable and inconstant.\n\nAt its worst, the precious qualities of imagination and flowing fantasy might turn out to weakness and thoughtlessness, turning in any direction that any wind may blow, getting lost in a dreamworld of surreal fantasies.</string>
    <string name="cups_knight_p">The Knight of Cups represents the Fire in the element of water, trying to bring the contrasts in balance, using the flaming fires to advocate the passive waters. Therefore, there is a certain instability within this Knights\' character, that can shift from one side to the other.\n\nBriah is the world of emotions and sensitivity, and the Knight of Cups might have good senses for art, poetry and lyric, his compassion can make him a good healer. If he manages to reach real depth and inner conviction, he will be able to provide rich tenderness and emotional warmth.\n\nOn the shadow side, his quickly rising emotions could be overwhelming, but without depth and reliability, when the fires of spontaneity won\'t be able to harmonize with the depth of the waters. He is friendly but passive, easy to inflame but his interest can fade as quick as it flamed up. So the Knight of Cups may also appear as an unsteady character, full of unripe ideas and failed attempts.</string>
    <string name="disks_01_p">The Ace of Disks represents the entity of the element Earth, the beginning of Assiah, the material world of making. It stands for the pureness of the element, and also for its seed, the first little sprout that later becomes a tree.\n\nSo the Ace of Disks can stand for the beginning of a material subject, this can be a physical project or a material value, which could mean the urge to material creation or the chance for material gain..\n\nBut, the Disks not only represent plain materials, but the entire world of Assiah, the actual, physical earth of daily life, and the actual, physical body of the human being. This implies home and profession, daily works, familiar bonding, health and well-being in common. And in this context, the Ace of Disks tells us that something will be created, something will begin.</string>
    <string name="disks_02_p">The Two of Disks represents the Earth in Chokmah, the realm of creation and energy, directing the pure material resources of the Ace towards a specific goal, in order to change from the raw material to the actual creation process.\n\nFurther, the card is called Harmonious Change, it stands for the alternation and natural balance of gain and loss, weakness and strength, growing and fading, ever varying occupation and wandering. In nature, everything is in constant change, well balanced with and in each other, building the principle of natural growing and proceeding.\n\nThe Two of Disks reminds us that we are still part of that nature, that we have to accept the natural flow of changes and handle it with care and consideration.</string>
    <string name="disks_03_p">The Three of Disks enters Binah, the fields of understanding and perception, initiating the process where the project that began in the Two of Disks is viewed and understood against its surrounding i.e. in its completion..\n\nThe card also talks of the alchemical wedding, in which the alchemical mercury combines sulphur with salt, thus building the living gold (the philosopher\'s stone). It implies the basic idea of Earth, the crystallisation of its powers and qualities, the commencement of matter to be established.\n\nThe name of the card is Works, saying that work was done to get that far, thus it implies a first taste of victory, an admission that a progress was made, a big step forward on the way. Though, further work will be needed to keep the achieved status and to proceed in it.</string>
    <string name="disks_04_p">The Four of Disks has reached the realm of Chesed, the fields of condensation, growth and stability, standing in the structural discipline of the Four. The work of the Three has paid off, the fruits are rich and manifold.\n\nTherefore, the Four of Disks represent success, establishment, proficiency, comfort and security not only in material values, but in familiar relations and profession either. Thus, the power it supplies is grown from peace and security, the well deserved reward for good work and concentrated effort. It has nothing to do with any ruling force, and it won\'t ask for it.\n\nOne the dark side, the four of Disks admonishes that any overrated attachment to comfort or possession results in fear of loss and failure, avarice, greed, hoarding, the comfortable power of peace turns into an ugly force that is directed against oneself.</string>
    <string name="disks_05_p">The Five of Disks finds itself in the changing movements of Geburah, but this is not the well balanced change of the Two of Disks, but an imbalanced, disruptive change, the effect of the 5 breaking up the stability of the 4, destroying its structure and balance.\n\nSo the Five of Disks represents a material crisis, which can also be a crisis in home and profession, an illness or injury, anything that disturbs or destroys the material, peaceful security of the Four.\n\nThere is not much to find when looking for the bright sight of the card, nevertheless it is a fact that every burning of a forest results in many little sprouts that appear afterwards, having the most fertile ground in the ashes. But of course, the old forest doesn\'t need to burn down completely - the card can also talk of the worry that it might do so just because it burns somewhere in the near.</string>
    <string name="disks_06_p">With the Six of Disks the Suit enters the harmonious realm of Tiphareth, back to the well-balanced middle of the Tree, leaving behind the crisis of the Five, regaining success and wealth.\n\nHaving experienced both the bad and good sides, gain and loss, the Six of Disks has achieved a wiser attitude towards material concerns. Nothing is taken for granted so easily anymore, and losses won\'t be taken for the end of the world. The material wealth is viewed in its actual value, not higher than it is, and not lower when we actually had expected more.</string>
    <string name="disks_07_p">The Seven of Disks are falling into Netzach, the fields of anarchy and destiny, and losing the harmonious peace of Tiphareth, this is a radical fall from paradise into the abysses of fate.\n\nFailure is the name of the card and program for its downfall, and so the Seven of Disks talk of hopes deceived and crushed, of unfilled promises, loss of fortune, dealings that first sounded good but later revealed as short-living or cheating, false successes with no lasting benefit, that in the end had cost much more than they had gained.\n\nThe hope within the card is the hand of Saturn, the father of time, who reminds us to wait for a chance instead of quickly jumping after any vague promise, to silently watch and reflect and get deeper insights into the coherence, until the time will come when a real chance shows up.</string>
    <string name="disks_08_p">For the Eight of Disks, the entering of Hod means a new beginning. The Disks have learned the lesson that Saturn has taught in the disastrous Seven, that everything needs time and consideration. Now here within Hod, the area of logic, the Eight of Disks develop prudence and patience.\n\nSo the Eight of Disks have learned to be careful, take their time to overthink their steps, considerate all facts and patiently wait for their chances. They absolve an apprenticeship in their own field, trying to do it better and avoid the mistakes from earlier stages.\n\nOn the dark side, the Eight of Disks can be over-careful, or careful just in small things while foolish in the big, over-anxious in front of risks, unable to come to any conclusion or decision, consideration with no end but finally doing nothing.</string>
    <string name="disks_09_p">The Nine of Disks have reached Yesod, the fields of imagination and reflection, but also of foundation, and in the latter the Disks meet their happiest realms.\n\nFully satisfied with themselves, they settle down comfortably and gather in the crops, the well-earned rewards for good accomplishment, while enjoying the shining charm of Venus putting everything in sweet light. The card can also stand for health, or successful convalescence after illness or injury.\n\nOn the darker side, the Nine of Disks can get so self-satisfied with material gain and success, that they forget about anything else.</string>
    <string name="disks_10_p">With the Ten of Disks the element of Earth has reached Malkuth, the final place of active manifestation - Assiah meets Assiah - and the Disks are in their very own home world.\n\nTherefore, the Ten of Disks are at the point where their richest potentials unfold, getting settled and staid, realizing the complete amount of material gain. Also, the Ten of Disks is the very last of the numbered cards, representing the completion of work, the full circle of Earth.\n\nOn the dark side, the Ten of Disks become fat, lazy, blinded by wealth and even greedy for more, then being busy with grabbing together more riches.</string>
    <string name="disks_princess_p">Princess of Disks (Upright)\n\nAs a part of the court cards the Princess of Disks has a strong potential to reference someone around you in real life. often the Princess is relatable to the quest of knowledge and advancement In Skill. however It may also pull on the Charms of witt when certain life choices need to be made.

The Element of Earth is the main Element of the Princess of Disks. Earth IS always finding new ways to Balance Itself out - Moving Things around can aid with this concept as well.\n\nPrincess of Disks (Love)\n\nBeing an Earth bound Element comes with Its own challenges. A lot of the Elemental community sees Earth Elementals as being luckyto be ... So solid in their foundation and beliefs but those set in stone traits of the Princess of Disks can be very Frustrating when It comes to the land of love. Never setting till you find Exactly What you have been Searching For. A true muse to assist you in life. An Equal mind to pair with and shame with. some one who has similar lifelong goals,hobbies and a just as curious appetite would be the perfect muse for the Princess of Particles.  on the other hand if yoU are already In a relationship or have been in a relationship for an on going period of time this card can really draw attention to a target issue.

    <string name="disks_prince_p">The Prince of Disks represents the Air in the element of Earth, he is stable and industrious and also thoughtful and inventive when it comes to improve matters.\n\nNevertheless, the Earth puts the brakes on the Air, therefore the Prince of Disks is slow in following and developing his plans and ideas, yet he is steady and unwavering - once on his path, he is going forward towards his goal.\n\nThe Prince of Disks can seem a bit cold in his emotions sometimes, yet he values his comfort and beauty. He is patient and tolerant, but once in rage, he hardly forgives.\n\nOn the shadow site, the Prince of Disks can get stubborn and ignorant, overly piqued on anything not belonging to his related surrounding, and phlegmatic up to total stagnation.</string>
    <string name="disks_queen_p">The Queen of Disks is the mother of her element, the water in the earth, which makes her the perfect mother, conforming and emotional as for the water and stable and reliable as for the Earth.\n\nThe Queen of Disks is kind and tender, friendly and good-hearted, she has fine instincts and intuitions. She is strong and sensitive, protects her house and family and cares as well for emotional and material well-being. She is calm and practicable and can be a good, industrious worker.\n\nBeneath the calm surface, the Queen of Disks can tend to lust and debauchery, fond of intoxicating stimulants, but she keeps it hidden. At the best, she will know that the dose makes the poison - at the bad, she won\'t.\n\nOn the dark side, the Queen of Disks lacks both the qualities of Air and Water, therefore she can get foolish and rather unintelligent, without pride and spirit, easily getting in needless dependence and being too weak to free herself - or even worse: not even trying to get free and independent.</string>
    <string name="disks_knight_p">The Knight of Disks represents the Fire in the element of Earth, and with Earth suppressing Fire, the materialism is the dominant aspect in this card, showing the Knight as a complex person of amazing strength, representing Earth in its function as provider of life.\n\nThe Knight of Disks is industrious and patient, steady and reliable, clever in material matters. He is the one working without asking much, concentrating on his tasks without getting distracted by mind games or high flying ideas. With more Earth than Fire and lacking the qualities of Air, the King of Disks is more dedicated to making but to thinking, his success results from instinct and pragmatism rather than from intellect or knowledge.\n\nFurther, the King of Disks lacks the emotional depth of Water, therefore he can have difficulties to understand or relate to others, he can be self-centered and sullen, intolerant and unable to put any interest in anything outside his own deeds and doings.\n\nAt the darkest side, the Knight of Disks can turn stubborn and even stupid, clumsy and jealous on anyone that seems higher than himself, arousing over tidbits and butting in everything, yet cowardly and unwilling to change himself.</string>
    <string name="swords_01_p">The Ace of Swords is the seed of the intellectual power, the origin and beginning of the airy world of Yetzirah, which implies thinking, analysing, realizing through logic and mind.\n\nLike every Ace, it represents the unstructured primary matter of its suit, the undifferentiated unity, therefore the Ace of Swords is the beginning of thinking, a first idea, a first thought or impulse from the mind and the essence of the element of Air.\n\nSo the card can stand for a first idea or realization, a new view of things, or simply tell us that we should let our mind work rather than following our emotions only. It also reminds as that the Ace is only the seed, that it needs growing and experience to proceed.</string>
    <string name="swords_02_p">The Two of Swords are representing the beginning of analysis, putting the pure, undirected ideas of the Ace underneath separation and differentiation, to bring them towards a specific form and end.\n\nChokmah is creation and manifestation, showing the element in its best light, and so the mind gets its best chance to indicate its powers without showing its shadows. For the Swords, this means peace, since the mind is on its finest level when just administering its potentials.</string>
    <string name="swords_03_p">With the Three, the Swords are entering Binah, the fields of understanding, of perception and realization, and they reveal the dark side of understanding - or the truth behind the common saying that idiots are the happier people.\n\nIt is the curse of the Swords to be so clear and honest, to analyze what others prefer to ignore, to put in plain light what others hide in the dark. They are not like the Cups who are lucky when they understand themselves, the Swords are the Mind and when understanding what they see, they dive into melancholy.\n\nSo the Three of Swords can talk of a painful realization, a hard decision that has to be made, the melancholy of Saturn when recognizing the unveiled truth. They also can stand for a disappointment, the loss of an illusion, or the detection of a treachery, a lie, a deceit.</string>
    <string name="swords_04_p">The Four of Swords has reached the fields of Chesed, manifestation and condensation, the winds of mind have settled and the powers of the element are well-balanced in themself.\n\nThe mind has solved a problem, found a solution, completed a process, or has come to a good, satisfying compromise. Jupiter keeps the scales of the libra in harmonious balance, and the truce can be enjoyed full-hearted.\n\nThough, for the Air stability means stagnate, therefore the restful truce should be used for reflection and reconsideration, the idea that has become full circle in the calm realms of Chesed needs to proceed to further levels.</string>
    <string name="swords_05_p">The Five of Swords have reached Geburah, the realm of motion and changing, of destruction and disintegration. The truce of the Four couldn\'t last, the airy Swords had to recognize that they never were meant for structure and stabilisation, that they needed to stick to their unsteady nature, no matter how high the price might be.\n\nThe deep crisis the Swords are going through in here also result in the influence of Venus, the planet of emotion, harmony and sensitivity. For the logical Swords who are forced to see everything absolutely clear and unveiled, too much sensitivity can mean a sharp pain that no reasonable argument might soften.\n\nIntelligent as they are, they clearly analyse the trap they\'re in and start struggling against fate, thus recognizing that they cannot win.</string>
    <string name="swords_06_p">In the beautiful harmony of Tiphareth, the Six of Swords have overcome the crisis of the Five, the emotional wounds are healed and the element concentrates on its origin potentials, its very own powers and qualities.\n\nIn science i.e. any fields of deeper thinking, the mind can unfold all its energies, and the restless Swords have the chance to combine the mind with the mental spirit from which it was born, to achieve a perfect harmony of it all.</string>
    <string name="swords_07_p">The Seven of Swords show the element with its reigns lose, storming into the realms of anarchy and destiny, fighting against \'nobody knows what\', getting entangled in many conflicting tendencies.\n\nNow none of the Suits is lucky within the Seven - the Wands burn down, the Cups nearly drown and the Disks are out cold - yet the Swords are least willing to accept their fate and activate every trick and list they can figure to get along. And considering that the Swords are pure intellect, they are embarrassingly good in figuring out tricks..\n\nTherefore, the Seven of Swords can talk of trickery, cheating, sudden affronts, juggling and intentional confusing with unrestrained Mercurian amorality. Though, all the lists are bound to fail, even the clever Swords cannot escape the hand of fate.</string>
    <string name="swords_08_p">With the Eight of Swords, the suit enters Hod, the realm of intellect and logic, and one should think how happy the Swords must be now that they are \'amongst fellows\'. But Hod is more the structure of mind, while the Swords are the freedom of mind - conflicts are pre-programmed.\n\nFurther, the Eight of Swords reveal the nature of the suit regarding its tendency of analysing and considering everything, digging out a counter-argument for any argument there is, quickly recognizing any limitation and conclusion that in the end means the interference in the own reasoning. Only the blessed ignorant can be self-confident enough to believe that their own thought is the only truth - the Swords cannot.\n\nIn another aspect, the Eight of Swords can talk of the restlessness of mind, of thoughts bursting out uncontrolled and unproductive, of nervous brooding and confused rumination.</string>
    <string name="swords_09_p">The Nine of Swords are entering Yesod, the fields of reflection and imagination, and while all other Suits made themself comfortable in blessing happiness, the Swords seem to be the outcast, called \'Cruelty\'.\n\nWith the airy nature of the mind, the Swords cannot rest, they cannot stop thinking and analyzing - and in the end, cannot ignore the fact that nothing really leads anywhere, that in the end there is nothing.\n(Take the technology of our century as one little example: the Wands praise the spirit of mankind, the Cups dream of all the goods that could be done, the Disks enjoy the riches it produces - the Swords analyse the effects and come to the conclusion that our planet gets destroyed.)\n\nTherefore, it is a bit unfair to call the Nine of Swords a bad card, or criticise it for cruelty or \'over-analysing\'. After all, we cannot expect the suit of the mind to tell us that we\'re better off with our heads in the sand, just to not see the cruel truth that is out there.</string>
    <string name="swords_10_p">With the Ten of Swords, the development of human intellect has consequently reached its last step - from the birth of intellect within the Ace to complete ruin within the grounds of the Ten.\n\nThe card teaches the lesson that endless fighting ends with destruction, endless analysis with the complete loss of hope and belief. It forces the lesson of the Nine of Swords to its inevitable conclusion. But with the Sun above it, it does not lack every hope. It will silently return to its origin again, to the first spark of mind in the Ace, to start all over again. The big hope in here is that the lessons from the journey absolved won\'t get forgotten.\n\nBy the way, every Ten in the Minor Arcana stands for the end of a process, for the need to restart or at least variate, only the Ten of Swords have an amazingly crude way to put it into words - that\'s just the way they are.</string>
    <string name="swords_princess_p">The Princess of Swords is the earthy child of her element, the wind over the grounds of Assiah. Her logic can be destructive, she is perceptive, serious and rigorous, yet she can show the characteristics of a child that lacks morality and nobility.\n\nTherefore, the Princess of Swords can get stubborn and cruel, and while beginning to think independently about something, she can turn very discriminating and egoistic, showing aggression whenever the result is not to her delight. In the Earth, all the free qualities of Air get suppressed and restricted.\n\nAt her best, the Princess of Swords can be very practical and clever, showing fine skills when dealing with material matters or conflicting opinions, she can be generous and kind once she lost the inner fear and insecurity that results from the natural incompatibility between Earth and Air.</string>
    <string name="swords_prince_p">Being Air in Air, the Prince of Swords is the pure manifestation of mind and intellect, full of plans and ideas which on the worst side may disturb and confuse each other, on the best create an inexhaustible spring of creative thoughts.\n\nThe Prince of Swords is intelligent, idealistic, full of creativity and fluidity, a real Mercurian spirit who often will argue just for the fondness of arguing - and not so much for the arguments themselves. The Prince of Swords can throw himself head over heels into a scientific research, reaching highest levels within a short time and then throw everything away without further notice because something else appears more interesting at the moment.\n\nOn the dark side, the Prince of Swords lacks both the qualities of Water and Earth, he can easily become unstable, unreliable and extremely moody, using his amount of intelligence to trick himself through life, becoming a master of disguise and cheat.</string>
    <string name="swords_queen_p">The Queen of Swords represents the Water in the Air, thus supplying the qualities of emotion and sensitivity to the airy element, the ability to transfer and reflect, to form and create. As the mother of the Air, she will have a strong dominance of intellect.\n\nThe Queen of Swords can be very sensitive, perceptive, sharp-witted and intelligent. On the dark side, she can turn cruel, malicious, narrow-minded, bigoted or even deceitful, dangerous, too, because of her charm and beauty.\n\nBeing water in air, the Queen of Swords lacks the stability of the Earth as well as the will of Fire. So she can lack practicality, steadiness, running the risk to live in an idealistic land of her own outside of reality. Further, she is sensible to interferences and disturbance from the outside, unable to protect herself against it.</string>

    <string name="wands_01_p">Like all Aces, the Ace of Wands symbolizes the roots and the entity of its element, here it is the root of Fire, the first spark to create the flaming powers of Atziluth, the world of the all-encompassing spiritual substance.\n\nBeing the essence of Fire, the Ace itself goes nowhere, but stands for the strong feeling that soon might turn into a strong will or plan. There is a spiritual power that has the ability to grow, it is completely up to us whether we use it or not.\n\nThe Ace of Wands might turn out to be bad when we cannot control or use its power that starts burning all out of a sudden, and all its riches get burned down before we can use them for good.</string>
    <string name="wands_02_p">The power of energy that is born in the Ace is given direction and a goal in the Two of Wands. Chokmah as the power of creation and energy is the best possible surrounding for the flaming forces, the first manifestation following the pure idea, the beginning of transformation.\n\nYet the card is not talking of consideration, let alone any cares. It comes up strong and recklessly, a wonderful thing when guiding at one good goal or project. Nevertheless, one should take at least a bit care that those wonderful powers won\'t crush anything around to pieces…</string>
    <string name="wands_03_p">The Three\'s are connected to Binah - the understanding. The untouched energies of the Two\'s have met the 3, the number of synthesis and harmony. They\'re no longer solitudes, they face up their meanings and surroundings. The Three of Wands is called \'Virtue\' - the powerful fire understands its responsibility.\n\nThe Three of Wands shows the powers of the element guided by understanding and awareness, the perfect precondition to begin a work or a project, to go ahead with a plan.</string>
    <string name="wands_04_p">The Four of Wands represents Chesed - the power of condensation, growth and stability, standing in the structural discipline of the 4 - the work is done, the plan was successful, the Fire has settled and reigns over its realms.\n\nFire is the element that stands for Atziluth, the world closest to divinity, and though the card might talk of every possible endeavour - a job, a relationship, an intellectual research, it is most likely aiming at something more spiritual.\nThis explains the upcoming of the card in such seemingly inappropriate situations like big family troubles or failed business projects - hereby the card shows us that we\'ve learned a lesson and that the failure in the \'profane\' world was just what we needed to achieve more spiritual maturity.</string>
    <string name="wands_05_p">Like all Fives, the Five of Wands stands for Geburah - motion and changing and the powers of destruction - and 5 is the number that breaks the stability and structure of the Four.\n\nFire isn\'t meant for settling and resting, and the flames burn high to break out of their own realm of the Four. This means revolutionary movements and aggressive renewals, and sometimes this isn\'t the most pleasant way to go. Especially not when we felt good and comfortable in the secure structure of the Four.\n\nIn the shadowy aspect, the violent disruption of the struggling flames can mean that we\'re just aggressive and restless, making trouble for no better reason than being bored.</string>
    <string name="wands_06_p">The crisis of the Five of Wands is overcome, the lesson was learned and has turned into a victory. In the middle of the Tree of Life, right in the beauty and harmony of Tiphareth, the flames of the fire appear like pure floating gold.\n\nThe Six of Wands shows that all the past troubles and disruptions have been necessary to grow and develop, and the victory we have now is more than just a gain by lucky chance. We have deserved it.</string>
    <string name="wands_07_p">The Seven of Wands is entering Netzach - the depths of creativity and anarchy standing under the number of destiny. And like for all the Seven\'s, the leaving of the beautiful Tiphareth comes like the fall from paradise. But Fire is a fighter, and though the element seems to be burning down, it will struggle to survive.\n\nSo the Seven of Wands talks of a situation where we have to face up forces stronger than ourself, situations that at first sight seem hopeless, yet we\'ll have to use all that we\'ve learned and fight.</string>
    <string name="wands_08_p">With the Eight of Wands the element of Fire enters Hod, the realm of intellect and logic, ruled by Mercury - thus an area much to its delight. Swiftness is what is demanded in here, decisive action in high speed mode.\n\nThe card can stand for sudden realizations, quick brainwaves, it can tell that the solution for a problem is already there or soon to come. It also reminds us that the spirit needs freedom to fly for otherwise it won\'t work at its best.\n\nThe shadow side of the card can mean that we waste too much time with disputing and all kinds of tidbits, instead of moving quick and decisively. In another aspect of course it the size of the dose that makes the poison effective - if we rush it too much we\'ll end up with a mass of particles that won\'t do us any good.</string>
    <string name="wands_09_p">Now the fiery Wands have reached the happy Nine, the number that reflects on itself, entering the fields of Yesod - imagination and reflection back in the middle of the Tree of Life.\n\nThus the Nine of Wands remembers the own qualities, showing the full powers of the fiery element rising again. So the card shows strength, determination and discipline, preparing itself for the final step to completion.\n\nThe shadow site of the card implies a warning - that we should use our spiritual consciousness to concentrate on our inner strength and master our will, and make it effective in the world we live in.</string>
    <string name="wands_10_p">The Ten of Wands are standing for suppression and restriction, showing the Fire on the grounds of the Earth, where they cause an uncontrolled, destructive burning.\n\nFire is not made to rest on the grounds, having lost the contact to the higher levels of spirit, it mutates to a blind and cruel force , not understanding the own self anymore. Fire is a power that has to be handled with imagination and reflection, not with stubbornness and hardened standards.\n\nTo understand the card, you have to understand the qualities of the Wands which stand for Chiah, the general living spark, the vitality of soul. You cannot force it down, a free bird cannot survive in a cage.</string>
    <string name="wands_princess_p">The Princess of Wands represents the Earth in the element of Fire, far from the Queen\'s depth and the Prince\'s Air. She\'s the Fire\'s daughter, with all the flaming energy of the Knight, unaffected from deeper emotions. The only heritage from her mother is the good memory for insults and the thirst for revenge.\n\nThough, while dancing in the flames, the Princess of Wands has her own beauty with her insatiable hunger for life and her endless, powerful energies. Her passion is hot, explosive and fast, burning down the object of desire and forgetting about it as soon as a new one comes in sight. Almost like Bizet\'s Carmen, she\'s irresistible in her seductive carelessness, in all her lust and anima.\n\nAt the shadow side, the Princess of Wands can lack all true warmth of the heart, faithless and self-indulgent, theatrical and unable to feel real compassion and understanding. At the worst, she can sink down in pure greed and cruelty, too cold and numbed to recognize the own emotional poverty and emptiness.</string>
    <string name="wands_prince_p">The Prince of Wands represents the Air within the Fire, intellect and storm within the spiritual flaming. As the son of the Queen, he bears a certain heritage of the waters inside of him, expressing in romantic beliefs and a most generous nature.\n\nThough, the attributes of fire are excessively strong, combined with the flying airs the first impression is that of a hot storm, filled with action and wilful, impulsive energies. Lacking the patience of the earth, the Prince of Wands wants it all and he wants it now, refusal or delays might provoke explosive outbursts. He has endless courage and tenacity, he can fight far superior forces until he has won.\n\nWith the airs whirled up by the hot breath of fire, he can be a juggler and trickster, wanton and frolic, recklessly abusing the powers of his mind to fool and ridicule the slow and harmless. He doesn\'t mean bad but usually storms forward too fast to recognize the ruins left behind.\n\nAt the shadowy side, all his attributes can exaggerate to their worst, resulting in reckless destruction and even in cruelty and sadism. His impatience can mount into instability, always seeking for novelty without getting anything done, with all his powers burning out unused.</string>
    <string name="wands_queen_p">Personifying the waters in the element of Fire, the Queen of Wands has a similar basic as the Knight of Cups, combining opposing elements when neither of the contrasts can overcome the other, thus having an unstable balance between them.\n\nAs a queen, she is the mother of her element, the emotion and the sensitivity, thus having her attributes of love, understanding and sympathy, her abilities to form and create, spending trust and warmth. The fiery character provides pride, passion, inspiration and powerful independence, her charisma, strength and expansiveness.\n\nDue to the imbalance in her character, the Queen of Wands can easily shift to her dark side, becoming a hot-tempered, revengeful fury, over dominant and possessive, taking the tiniest bit as a reason to bear an grudge for years. She never forgets and never forgives, and as easily her fiery temper makes her forget own mistakes, so deeply her watery depths can cause her to ponder long and broad about the mistakes of others.\nMissing the stability of earth and the logic of air, tolerance and self-control never were her best disciplines.</string>
    <string name="wands_knight_p">Being fire in fire, the Knight of Wands is the purest manifestation of his element - burning, flaming, enthusiastic and thrilling. He is the born leader, full of ideas and idealism, proud and commanding, at his best noble, honest, conscientious and intelligent.\n\nFor Atziluth is the highest of the worlds and Fire the highest of the elements, the Knight of Wands can stand for highest inspirations, spiritual realisation and purest creativity.\n\nBut with fire in fire, the Knight of the Wands lacks the depths of waters, the stability of earth and the analyzing logic of air. His strength might degenerate to pure tyranny, his convictions stiffen to dogmatism, he might get cruel, bigot and brutal at his worst.\nFurther the fires within fire lack the sources of reserved potentials, so once the explosion is over, there is nothing more left for the Knight to provide.</string>
